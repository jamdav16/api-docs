# api-docs

I wanted to create some documentation to drive a project. More precisely,
I wanted to document a REST web service API, so that I could then build
implementations of the API for multiple platforms.

I really like [Stripe's API documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/api)&mdash;it's
clean, well organized, responsive, and supports presenting code samples
for multiple platforms.

I spent a little bit of time looking for a framework to speed development
of my document, and I couldn't find anything that was both beautiful
and simple to use. I didn't need a generator, I just wanted something
pretty and approachable.

So I made this: *api-docs*.
